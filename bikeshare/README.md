# Bikeshare

An experimental bikeshare project with donated bikes. Trying to make a few
bucks to supplement my Social Security, and provide a useful service for far
less than the commercial bikeshares.

After generating the QR codes with `make`, view bikeshare.html with a browser,
then screenshot the page. Invert it using
`convert screenshot.png -flop bikeshare-flopped.png`, and print it on a
transparency. Glue the transparency to a piece of opaque plastic and mount
it within the diamond frame of a bike.
