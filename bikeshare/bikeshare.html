<h2>Ride at your own risk!</h2>
<p>Check brakes and tires before starting your ride. You can refill tires at
some gas stations around town, the one at Caulfield and Lakeville is free.
There are also hand pumps available, but unfortunately most have had parts
stolen by ungrateful opportunists. If you see any such lowlife trash
eyeing my bike, please let me know&mdash;jc &lt;micropayments@unternet.net&gt;
